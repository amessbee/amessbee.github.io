- abstract: Vulnerability identification constitutes a task of high importance for
    cyber security. It is quite helpful for locating and fixing vulnerable functions
    in large applications. However, this task is rather challenging owing to the absence
    of reliable and adequately managed datasets and learning models. Existing solutions
    typically rely on human expertise to annotate datasets or specify features, which
    is prone to error. In addition, the learning models have a high rate of false
    positives. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a properly curated C/C++
    source code vulnerability dataset, denoted as CVEFunctionGraphEmbeddings (CVEFGE),
    to aid in developing models. CVEFGE is automatically crawled from the CVE database,
    which contains authentic and publicly disclosed source code vulnerabilities. We
    also propose a learning framework based on graph neural networks, denoted SEquential
    Graph Neural Network (SEGNN) for learning a large number of code semantic representations.
    SEGNN consists of a sequential learning module, graph convolution, pooling, and
    fully connected layers. Our evaluations on two datasets and four baseline methods
    in a graph classification setting demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

  title: Sequential Graph Neural Networks for Source Code Vulnerability Identification

- abstract: A dominating set of a graph $\mathcal{G=(V, E)}$ is a subset of vertices
    $S\subseteq\mathcal{V}$ such that every vertex $v\in \mathcal{V} \setminus S$
    outside the dominating set is adjacent to a vertex $u\in S$ within the set. The
    minimum dominating set problem seeks to find a dominating set of minimum cardinality
    and is a well-established NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We propose
    a novel learning-based heuristic approach to compute solutions for the minimum
    dominating set problem using graph convolutional networks. We conduct an extensive
    experimental evaluation of the proposed method on a combination of randomly generated
    graphs and real-world graph datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed learning-based
    approach can outperform a classical greedy approximation algorithm. Furthermore,
    we demonstrate the generalization capability of the graph convolutional network
    across datasets and its ability to scale to graphs of higher order than those
    on which it was trained. Finally, we utilize the proposed learning-based heuristic
    in an iterative greedy algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
    computation of dominating sets.

- abstract: Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional
    functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological
    conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional Magnetic
    Resonance Imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly
    modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning
    methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step
    in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the
    transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain remains surprisingly
    under-explored due to the expansive preprocessing pipeline and large parameter
    search space for graph-based datasets construction. In this paper, we introduce
    NeuroGraph, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets that span multiple
    categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset
    generation search space by crafting 35 datasets within both static and dynamic
    contexts, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally,
    we provide generic frameworks for learning on dynamic as well as static graphs.
    Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation
    vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest,
    and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements
    in graph-based data driven Neuroimaging, we offer a comprehensive open source
    Python package that includes the datasets, baseline implementations, model training,
    and standard evaluation. The package is publicly accessible at https://anwar-said.github.io/anwarsaid/neurograph.html

  title: Resilient distributed vector consensus using centerpoint
  venue: Automatica (2022)
  year: 2022
- abstract: A network of reinforcement learning (RL) agents that cooperate with each
    other by sharing information can improve learning performance of control and coordination
    tasks when compared to non-cooperative agents. However, networked Multi-agent
    Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is vulnerable to adversarial agents that can compromise
    some agents and send malicious information to the network. In this paper, we consider
    the problem of resilient MARL in the presence of adversarial agents that aim to
    compromise the learning algorithm. First, the paper presents an attack model which
    aims to degrade the performance of a target agent by modifying the parameters
    shared by an attacked agent. In order to improve the resilience, the paper presents
    aggregation methods using medoid and soft-medoid. Our analysis shows that the
    medoid-based MARL algorithms converge to an optimal solution given standard assumptions,
    and improve the overall learning performance and robustness. Simulation results
    show the effectiveness of the aggregation methods compared with average and median-based
    aggregation.

- abstract: Flocking control of a group of mobile agents has been recently investigated
    using Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs). The design relies on training using a
    centralized controller but the resulting GCN controller is based on communication
    between the agents. The agents receive sensor measurements which are incorporated
    into the states and shared between the neighbors. However, the paradigm is prone
    to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing GCN-based
    distributed flocking control that is resilient to attacks on the communicated
    information. We consider an attack model that is used to compromise the inter-agent
    communication and may inject arbitrary signals. Our control design uses a coordinate-wise
    median-based aggregation function. It is shown that the GCN-based controller using
    the proposed aggregation method is resilient against attacks on the communication
    between the agents, whereas the typical average-based aggregation fails to maintain
    the flock structure. Robustness analysis is performed to show that the proposed
    method is resilient whenever a majority of the agents in the neighborhood can
    be trusted. Simulation results and analysis are presented that validate the merits
    of the proposed approach.

  venue: Autom. (2022)
  year: 2022
- abstract: This paper studies the problem of computing a minimum zero forcing set
    (ZFS) in graphs. The problem is important because it is directly related to the
    leader selection problem for the strong structural controllability of networks
    defined over graphs. Computing a ZFS of minimum size is a well-known NP-hard problem
    in general. We show that previously known greedy heuristic could give arbitrarily
    bad solutions for some graphs. We study the problem on trees and present an optimal
    algorithm to compute a minimum ZFS in linear time in trees. For general graphs,
    we present a game-theoretic solution by formalizing the minimum ZFS problem as
    a potential game. Finally, we numerically evaluate our results on random graphs.

- abstract: "Distributed machine learning algorithms are increasingly used in multirobot\
    \ systems and are prone to Byzantine attacks. In this article, we consider a distributed\
    \ implementation of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm in a cooperative\
    \ network, where networked agents optimize a global loss function using SGD on\
    \ the local data and aggregation of the estimates of immediate neighbors. Byzantine\
    \ agents can send arbitrary estimates to their neighbors, which may disrupt the\
    \ convergence of normal agents to the optimum state. We show that if every normal\
    \ agent combines its neighbors\u2019 estimates (states) such that the aggregated\
    \ state is in the convex hull of its normal neighbors\u2019 states, then the resilient\
    \ convergence is guaranteed. To assure this sufficient condition, we propose a\
    \ resilient aggregation rule based on the notion of centerpoint, which is a generalization\
    \ of the median in the higher-dimensional Euclidean space. We evaluate our results\
    \ using examples of target pursuit and pattern recognition in multirobot systems.\
    \ The evaluation results demonstrate that distributed learning with average, coordinate-wise\

- abstract: "In this letter, we study the maximum edge augmentation problem in directed\
    \ Laplacian networks to improve their robustness while preserving lower bounds\
    \ on their strong structural controllability (SSC). Since adding edges could adversely\
    \ impact network controllability, the main objective is to maximally densify a\
    \ given network by selectively adding missing edges while ensuring that SSC of\
    \ the network does not deteriorate beyond certain levels specified by the SSC\
    \ bounds. We consider two widely used bounds: first is based on the notion of\
    \ zero forcing (ZF), and the second relies on the distances between nodes in a\
    \ graph. We provide an edge augmentation algorithm that adds the maximum number\
    \ of edges in a graph while preserving the ZF-based bound, and also derive a closed-form\
    \ expression for the exact number of edges added to the graph. Then, we examine\
    \ the edge augmentation while preserving the distance-based bound and present\

- abstract: "In this paper, we study the resilient vector consensus problem in networks\
    \ with adversarial agents and improve resilience guarantees of existing algorithms.\
    \ A common approach to achieving resilient vector consensus is that every non-adversarial\
    \ (or normal) agent in the network updates its state by moving towards a point\
    \ in the convex hull of its normal neighbors\u2019 states. Since an agent cannot\
    \ distinguish between its normal and adversarial neighbors, computing such a point,\
    \ often called as safe point , is a challenging task. To compute a safe point,\
    \ we propose to use the notion of centerpoint , which is an extension of the median\
    \ in higher dimensions, instead of Tverberg partition of points, which is often\
    \ used for this purpose. We discuss that the notion of centerpoint provides a\
    \ complete characterization of safe points in R d . In particular, we show that\
    \ a safe point is essentially an interior centerpoint if the number of adversaries\
    \ in the neighborhood of a normal agent i is less than N i d +1 , where d is the\
    \ dimension of the state vector and N i is the total number of agents in the neighborhood\
    \ of i . Consequently, we obtain necessary and su\uFB03cient conditions on the\
    \ number of adversarial agents to guarantee resilient vector consensus. Further,\
    \ by considering the complexity of computing centerpoints, we discuss improvements\
    \ in the resilience guarantees of vector consensus algorithms and compare with\
    \ the other existing approaches. Finally, we numerically evaluate the performance\
    \ of our approach through experiments."

    \ in such networks, and a strategy to maximize the number of participating individuals.\
    \ Unlike most of the existing literature, our model incorporates both the network\
    \ structure and the heterogeneity of individuals in terms of their attributes\
    \ and resources. We consider that each individual possesses a subset of available\
    \ resources (attributes), which it shares with neighbors as long as neighbors\
    \ reciprocate and provide the missing resources to the individual. However, individual\
    \ leaves the network if it cannot find all the resources in its neighborhood.\
    \ To model this phenomenon, we introduce a graph-theoretic notion of the $(r,s)$-core,\
    \ which is the sub-network consisting of only those individuals who can access\
    \ all the resources by collaborating with their neighbors. Since disengagement\
    \ of an individual could initiate a cascading withdrawal of more individuals from\
    \ the network, one of our main goals is to prevent this unraveling and maximize\
    \ the number of participating individuals. For this purpose, we utilize the notion\
    \ of anchors\u2014individuals that continue to participate (due to incentives)\
    \ even if they cannot find all of the resources in their neighborhood. By introducing\
    \ only a few anchors, we can significantly increase the number of participating\
    \ individuals, which in our model corresponds to increasing the size of the $(r,s)$-core.\
    \ We formulate and thoroughly analyze the anchors\u2019 selection problem by classifying\
    \ the cases in which the problem is polynomial-time solvable, NP-complete, and\
    \ inapproximable. Further, we provide greedy and metaheuristic search algorithms\
    \ to compute a set of anchors and evaluate our results on various networks. Our\
    \ results are applicable to a large number of cooperative networking applications,\
    \ including participatory sensing in which users develop an elaborate knowledge\
    \ of their environment through sharing measurements."

  title: Resilient Vector Consensus in Multi-Agent Networks Using Centerpoints
  venue: 2020 American Control Conference (ACC) (2020)
  year: 2020
- abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between resilience and accuracy
    in the resilient distributed multidimensional consensus problem. We consider a
    network of agents, each of which has a state in Rd. Some agents in the network
    are adversarial and can change their states arbitrarily. The normal (non-adversarial)
    agents interact locally and update their states to achieve consensus at some point
    in the convex hull $\mathcal{C}$ of their initial states. This objective is achievable
    if the number of adversaries in the neighborhood of normal agents is less than
    a specific value, which is a function of the local connectivity and the state
    dimension d. However, to be resilient against adversaries, especially in the case
    of large d, the desired local connectivity is large. We discuss that resilience
    against adversarial agents can be improved if normal agents are allowed to converge
    in a bounded region $\mathcal{B} \supseteq \mathcal{C}$, which means normal agents
    converge at some point close to but not necessarily inside $\mathcal{C}$ in the
    worst case. The accuracy of resilient consensus can be measured by the Hausdorff
    distance between $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}$. As a result, resilience can
    be improved at the cost of accuracy. We propose a resilient bounded consensus
    algorithm that exploits the trade-off between resilience and accuracy by projecting
    d-dimensional states into lower dimensions and then solving instances of resilient
    consensus in lower dimensions. We analyze the algorithm, present various resilience
    and accuracy bounds, and also numerically evaluate our results.

  title: Interplay Between Resilience and Accuracy in Resilient Vector Consensus in
    Multi-Agent Networks
  venue: 2020 59th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) (2020)
  year: 2020
- abstract: We consider the problem of networked agents cooperating together to perform
    a task of optimizing the parameters of a global cost function. Agents receive
    linearly correlated noisy streaming data that can be used to learn the target
    parameters via Least-Mean-Squares (LMS) approaches. Diffusion scheme is incorporated
    such that at each step after agents adapt the parameters by the current received
    data, a combination step is included for agents to aggregate the information coming
    from its one-hop neighbors. It has been demonstrated that by introducing the aggregation
    step, diffusion algorithms greatly improve the learning accuracy of the parameters
    measured by the network Mean-Square-Deviation (MSD) [1]. However, the aggregation
    step is susceptible to attacks. In the presence of Byzantine agents, the aggregation
    of Byzantine information can easily disrupt the convergence of normal robots and
    even one Byzantine agent can drive its normal neighbors to converge to some point
    desired by the attacker [2]. To address this, we propose a resilient aggregation
    rule based on the notion of centerpoint [3], which is a generalization of median
    in the higher dimensional Euclidean space. We show that if a normal robot implements
    the centerpoint based aggregation rule for distributed diffusion, then it can
    guarantee the aggregated result to lie inside the convex hull of its normal neighbors,
    given at most [EQUATION] neighbors are Byzantine with n total negihbors and d-dimensional
    state vectors exchanged among agents. Further, we demonstrate all normal robots
    implementing centerpoint based distributed diffusion converge resiliently to the
    true target state. In addition, we demonstrate that widely adopted aggregation
    rules such as coordinate-wise median [4] and geometric median [5] based are not
    resilient under certain conditions. The main reason is that unlike centerpoint
    based aggregation, these rules do not guarantee the aggregation result to be inside
    the convex hull of the states of normal agents. We carried out experiments on
    Robotarium, a multirobot testbed developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology
    to demonstrate the cases where diffusion with coordinate-wise median and geometric
    median based aggregation rules fail to converge to the true target state, whereas
    diffusion with centerpoint based rule resiliently converge to the true target
    state in the same scenario.

- abstract: 'We study the strong structural controllability (SSC) of diffusively coupled
    networks, where the external control inputs are injected to only some nodes, namely
    the leaders. For such systems, one measure of controllability is the dimension
    of strong structurally controllable subspace, which is equal to the smallest possible
    rank of controllability matrix under admissible (positive) coupling weights. In
    this paper, we compare two tight lower bounds on the dimension of strong structurally
    controllable subspace: one based on the distances of followers to leaders, and
    the other based on the graph coloring process known as zero forcing. We show that
    the distance-based lower bound is usually better than the zero-forcing-based bound
    when the leaders do not constitute a zero-forcing set. On the other hand, we also
    show that any set of leaders that can be shown to achieve complete SSC via the
    distance-based bound is necessarily a zero-forcing set. Furthermore, we present
    a novel bound based on the combination of these two approaches, which is always
    at least as good as, and in some cases strictly greater than, the maximum of the
    two bounds. Finally, we present some numerical results to compare the bounds on

- abstract: A network of agents with linear dynamics is strong structurally controllable
    if agents can be maneuvered from any initial state to any final state independently
    of the coupling strengths between agents. If a network is not strong structurally
    controllable with given input nodes (leaders), then the dimension of strong structurally
    controllable subspace quantifies the extent to which a network can be controlled
    by the same inputs. Computing this dimension exactly is computationally challenging.
    In this paper, we study the problem of computing a sharp lower bound on the dimension
    of strong structurally controllable subspace in networks with Laplacian dynamics.
    The bound is based on a sequence of vectors containing distances between leaders
    and the remaining nodes in the underlying network graph. Such vectors are referred
    to as the distance-to-leader vectors. We provide a polynomial time algorithm to
    compute a desired sequence of distance-to-leader vectors with a fixed set of leaders,
    which directly provides a lower bound on the dimension of strong structurally
    controllable subspace. We also present a linearithmic approximation algorithm
    to compute such a sequence, which provides near optimal solutions in practice.
    Finally, we numerically evaluate and compare our bound with other bounds in the
    literature on various networks.

    derive tight upper and lower bounds on the structural robustness of networks based
    on the average distance between nodes and the average node degree. Using the proposed
    bounds, we characterize the networks with different types of robustness scaling
    under increasing size. Furthermore, we present a fundamental tradeoff between
    the structural robustness and the average degree of networks. While this tradeoff
    implies that a desired level of structural robustness can only be achieved by
    graphs with a sufficiently large average degree, we also show that there exist
    dense graphs with poor structural robustness. We then show that random <inline-formula><tex-math

    before being disseminated for research and analysis. This anonymization process
    distorts the data so that some essential characteristics are lost which may not
    be captured by methods that are not robust against such transformations. In this
    paper we propose novel algorithms, for two-dimensional data, for a recently discovered
    statistical data analysis measure, the Ray Shooting Depth (RSD) that provides
    an affine-invariant ranking of data points. In addition, we prove some complexity
    results and illustrate some of the desirable properties of RSD via comparisons
    with other similar notions. We develop an open-source data visualization tool
    based on RSD, and show its applications in distribution estimation, outlier detection,
    and D tolerance-region construction.

- abstract: The problem of identifying important players in a given network is of
    pivotal importance for viral marketing, public health management, network security
    and various other fields of social network analysis. In this work we find the
    most important vertices in a graph G = (V,E) to immunize so as the chances of
    an epidemic outbreak is minimized. This problem is directly relevant to minimizing
    the impact of a contagion spread (e.g. flu virus, computer virus and rumor) in
    a graph (e.g. social network, computer network) with a limited budget (e.g. the
    number of available vaccines, antivirus software, filters). It is well known that
    this problem is computationally intractable (it is NP-hard). In this work we reformulate
    the problem as a budgeted combinational optimization problem and use techniques
    from spectral graph theory to design an efficient greedy algorithm to find a subset
    of vertices to be immunized. We show that our algorithm takes less time compared
    to the state of the art algorithm. Thus our algorithm is scalable to networks
    of much larger sizes than best known solutions proposed earlier. We also give
    analytical bounds on the quality of our algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate the
    efficacy of our algorithm on a number of real world networks and demonstrate that
    the empirical performance of algorithm supplements the theoretical bounds we present,
    both in terms of approximation guarantees and computational efficiency.

- abstract: Given a network of nodes, minimizing the spread of a contagion using a
    limited budget is a well-studied problem with applications in network security,
    viral marketing, social networks, and public health. In real graphs, virus may
    infect a node which in turn infects its neighbor nodes and this may trigger an
    epidemic in the whole graph. The goal thus is to select the best k nodes (budget
    constraint) that are immunized (vaccinated, screened, filtered) so as the remaining
    graph is less prone to the epidemic. It is known that the problem is, in all practical
    models, computationally intractable even for moderate sized graphs. In this paper
    we employ ideas from spectral graph theory to define relevance and importance
    of nodes. Using novel graph theoretic techniques, we then design an efficient
    approximation algorithm to immunize the graph. Theoretical guarantees on the running
    time of our algorithm show that it is more efficient than any other known solution
    in the literature. We test the performance of our algorithm on several real world
    graphs. Experiments show that our algorithm scales well for large graphs and outperforms
    state of the art algorithms both in quality (containment of epidemic) and efficiency
    (runtime and space complexity).

    \ by Mudassir Shabbir Dissertation Director: William Steiger In this thesis we\
    \ present some new results in the field of discrete and computational geometry.\
    \ The techniques and tools developed to achieve these results add to our understanding\
    \ of important geometric objects like line arrangements, and geometric measures\
    \ of depth. Small Hitting Sets Given a set S of n points, a weak -net X is a set\
    \ of points (not necessarily in S) such that any convex set, called a range, that\
    \ contains more than an fraction of S must meet X for a fixed > 0 [30]. Aronov\
    \ et al. gave the first bounds on when the cardinality of X is a fixed small number\
    \ in the plane. Later Mustafa and Ray proved that |X| = 2 can be chosen so that\
    \ we hit all convex ranges that contain 4n/7 points of S [46]. We describe an\
    \ O(n log n) time algorithm to find points z1 6= z2, at least one of which must\

- abstract: The notion of Ray Shooting Depth was introduced in recent papers of Gromov,
    and of Fox, Gromov, Laorgue, Naor, and Pach. It played a key role in their results.
    It also represents a new concept for data depth in R d and oers interesting possibilities
    for applications. Here, we study some computational aspects of ray-shooting depth
    in dimension two via algorithms and some complexity results. In addition we advocate
    the use of ray-shooting depth in statistical data analysis and in other applications.
    We illustrate some of the desireable properties via comparisons with other notions
    of depth.

- abstract: The Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm is a local sequence alignment algorithm
    that attempts to align two biological sequences of varying length such that the
    alignment score is maximum. In this paper, we propose a new approach to reduce
    the time needed to perform the SW algorithm. This is done by applying the concept
    of recursive variable expansion, which exposes more parallelism in the algorithm
    than any other published method. The paper estimates the speed and hardware overhead
    for the newly proposed approach relative to other known acceleration methods.
    Using the new approach, it is possible to achieve a minimum speedup of 400 times
    better than the serial case for a typical sequence length of 500, which is 1.6
    times higher than any other published method. The paper also shows that further
    speedup can be achieved using extra hardware to expose even more parallelism in
    the algorithm.

- abstract: Biological sequence alignment is one of the most important problems in
    computational biology. Given two sequences of varying length are aligned such
    that the alignment score i s maximum. The alignment score is calculated based
    on the number of matches, mismatches and gaps in the alignment suggest d. The
    basic sequence alignment algorithms are Needleman-Wun sch (NW) algorithm and Smith-Waterman
    (SW) algorithm, which find the optimal global and local alignment, respectively.
    I n this paper, we have accelerated the Needleman-Wunsch by applyin g the Recursive
    Variable Expansion partially, which can be ea sily implemented on FPGA. This method
    extract more parallelism than other prevalent parallel implementations and we
    are able to achieve a speed up of 1.55 times.

- abstract: "Sequence classi\uFB01cation algorithms, such as SVM, require a de\uFB01\
    nition of distance (similarity) measure between two sequences. A commonly used\
